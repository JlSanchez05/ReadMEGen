# Professional README Generator Starter Code

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

This is a command line interface application which allows users who run the application on they're terminal
to create a professional Read me file. When the application is being used it allows the user to choose from
a set of predefined questions which will allow the user to generate the read me file without having to go back
to github and do it manually from there.
